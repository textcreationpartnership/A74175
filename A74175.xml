         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are not ignorant that the inceſſant Malice of ſome indiſpoſed, or rather deſperate men (like Cockle amongſt Corn) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue indeavouring by all the means they can to hinder the growth and pervert the Iudgements of ſuch Our good People, as are willing to recover their loſt Duty and Obedience to Vs, notwithſtanding the prudent care of Iudirious, Vnpaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and Vnintereſſed Perſons, to Compoſe the differences and heal the Wounds which have ſo long been kept open and raw by the Blood-Thirſty, who beleiving their Crimes to be beyond pardon, endeavour, like <hi>Pilate,</hi> to mingle Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood with their former impious Sacrifices, towards whom all Gracious mercies and Conceſſions are caſt away.</p>
            <p>We have therefore thought fit, once more, out of Our Princely Compaſſion towards thoſe, whoſe Sins are in their ſight, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently repented, as by their daily Expreſſions, are brought to Vs at this diſtance, which hath not ever heretofore been known to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and Subjects; We ſay, We have thought fit again to Declare Our propenſe readineſs to embrace all Our Loving Subjects with the Armes of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, who ſhall no longer value themſelves above Our Mercy, or their Crimes above Forgiveneſs, which cannot be of that deep remembrance with Vs.</p>
            <p>Nor are We without a deep ſence of their wilfull Sufferings, who like weak Spirited Women and Children, are willing to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Infirmities, rather then admit the diſtaſte and operation of a healing Remedy: What invitation can We indeed offer unto them after they have ſlighted the preſervation of their own Inheritance and their Laws, and that nearer Obligation, their Religion; For having wilfully reſigned the properties of their Poſſeſſions, and more unhappily reſiſted the means of their Salvation; Our hopes alſo may ſeem deſperate, though we ſet before them all the Fruitions which this and the next World can enable Vs to perform.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, <hi>in imitation of Our Heavenly Father</hi> (by whom, and in whoſe Lively Image Kings Reign) We do again hereby offer a Free Pardon and Indempnity to all ſuch of Our Loving Subjects as ſhall embrace the ſame, and in Teſtimony thereof prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Peaceably to receive, and Dutiful to Defend Vs at Vur coming, againſt the Vn-chriſtian Attempts of ſuch, as ſhall (if any ſuch there be) continue or combine further to reſiſt Our Lawfull Claim and Peaceable Poſſeſſion of thoſe Our undoubted Kingdoms of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> We ſay We do hereby tender unto them a Free and General pardon: Will you therefore that We come unto you in the Spirit of Meekneſs, or in Revenge? It is in your own Power to put a Scepter or a Rod into Our hands?</p>
            <p>It is well known unto Vs that you feel and confeſs your ruines to be grounded upon your Diſobedience, and will you yet againſt that Mercy of God which hath opened your Eyes, continue your Obſtinacy and undo your Confeſſion by denying your Converſion? Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Little Ones, and read in them the Multiplication of your Sufferings whoſe future reflections upon your Rebellions and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, muſt leave them miſeraole, and the remembrance of their Anceſtors odious: know, That if you further provoke Vs to uſe thoſe helps which Our Royal Conſanguinities do daily offer unto Our Aſſiſtance, and which We muſt be moſt unwillingly inforced to embrace, that the Charge thereof your Eſtates muſt compenſate, if by no other preſident or relation, then that of your own injuſtice in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If thoſe who Travel the Seas with Merchandies will truly relate unto you their Returns, you will apparently ſee the decay of your Tradings in general; For We well know that if your Merchants miſcarry, your Huſbandry and Manufactures will lie heavy upon you; of which We hear daily Complaints, and are willing to eaſe the ſame, if by Your Obedience You would bring them within Our Power.</p>
            <p>If any amongſt You cry out of Tender Conſciences? Who could offer more towards their Conſolation then We have formerly in all Our Declarations Erpreſſed? and in caſe that do yet continue to be an Obſtacle, We aſſure You in the word of a King, and your King, that You ſhall fully injoy ſuch Libertie to Your Souls as Your own Repreſentatives in <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> together with Your moſt Learned Divines ſhall adviſe.</p>
            <p>Paradventure the Souldiers amongſt You <hi>(as well knowing their want of legal Title to the Eſtates they poſſeſs, as the unwillingneſs of the People to ſatisfie their Demands in Arrears, may withſtand other mens more moderate deſires;)</hi> As to them who are in poſſeſſion of Our own and other Mens Inheritances, We ſhall for avoidance of Partialitie leave them alſo to the Iudicature of their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, either to continue their Poſſeſſions, or to redeem them on ſuch Terms as their own Wiſdom ſhall moſt approve; and for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears unpaid to the Common Souldiers, it will be, We aſſure You, Our firſt care to diſcharge them ſo ſoon as We ſhall be in Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poſſeſſion of Our Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>There remains no more, but that upon Our Princely Word. We will be readie to joyn with all Our Loving Subjects for the ſetling of an Everlaſting Peace, the firſt ſtep whereto is an Amenſtitia and abſolute Oblivion to all which is paſt, which on Our part ſhall be ſo inviolably kept, as thoſe who have been Our moſt Proteſt Enemies, ſhall not receive the leaſt Endamaging Affront from Our moſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Friends; And as We are the Vndeniable Lawfull Deputy of GOD ſhall as near as We can, ſtudie and endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Him in Mercie and Iuſtice, to as many of You as acknowledge and obey Vs Your true and undoubted Soveraign</p>
